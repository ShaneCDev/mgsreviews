# MGSR - Movies, Games, Shows Reviews

This is an extension of a website I made for my first project and it's a review website for anyone that loves Movies, Games, TV Shows and want to express how they feel about said media. The main purpose is to get some healthy non-toxic reviews and perspectives about media that we all know and love and even some that we don't know nor love, if theres something that you haven't seen or played and are abit skeptical about it then feel free to read the reviews and go from there!
